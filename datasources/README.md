# [BEAD 2024 Practice Project - Group 1] Datasources

This folder contains datasources to be used in the Spark processes.

## bead_postgres

This is the primary database the currently contains all taxi availability information.

## csv

This folder contains sample data for the output from Benthos.

The file's name is based on the current system's time (the date). A new file will get created when it crosses over to
the next day.

We don't intend to check the data in as `git` is not really designed version and store data.
